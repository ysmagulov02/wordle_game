# Game specification

This is my own implementation of a famous word-guessing game wordle. 

For those of you who don't know what this game is about, the rules are pretty simple.

There is a particular 5-letter English word for each puzzle, and the player has to find out what that word is by making a series of gusses. Each time a player makes a guess, they see the inputted letters in gray, yellow,, or green boxes. Gray means the letter is not in the word, yellow - the letter is in the word, but not at that postion and green means the letter is in the word at that position. If a player guesses the secret word in less than 6 guesses, they win.
